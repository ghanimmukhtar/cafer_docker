# cafer_docker
Cafer ready development environment bundled as docker images.

## Goal

Solve usual issues in development environments:
- Managing several versions of a same libraries.
- Share quickly your development environment for an experiment with others and be SURE that it works.

Others solutions:
- **Virtual machines**:
    - Add a great performance overhead
    - Takes a lot of space: one VM per development environment / experiment.
- **Vagrant**:
  - Takes a lot of disk space
  - The development environment is not modulable: changing a library version in the VM involves either building a new VM or deal with differents libs as on the baremetal machine.

### **Docker**
- It builds containers using isolation features from the Linux kernel. Containers act as virtual machines without the performance overhead.
- Use AUFS to share similarities between different images and save a lot of diskspace
- It is possible to build a specific library / application version in a container, expose its files to others containers so they can use it.
- The last point make it the dev environment modular: want another version of the same lib? Change the corresponding container.

## Requirements:

- Linux OS with kernel >=3.10
- [Docker-Engine >=1.10](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- [Docker-Compose >=1.6](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Regarding Docker-Compose

The same project could be achieved without Docker-Compose, as if one look at the [docker-compose.yml file](https://github.com/robotsthatdream/cafer_docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml),
the instructions of the yaml file come from the *docker run* and *docker build* tools. Docker-Compose just makes this task way easier.

**âš ** Please note that Docker-Compose instructions have precedence over similar instructions put in a Dockerfile.

## How-to
### Launch demo development environment

To launch the development environment, you need:
- To create the folder structure /home/$USER/DockerData/catkin_ws/src 
  If you want another folder to sync data between your dev environment and the host, edit the corresponding line in the docker-compose.yml file:

    ```YAML
    ide_data:
      build: ./IDE_data
      image: ide_data:v1
      volumes:
        - /THE_HOST_PATH_YOU_WANT:/home/docker_user/catkin_ws/src
        - /home/docker_user/catkin_ws
      command: chown -R 1000:1000 /home/docker_user/catkin_ws
    ```
    
- To run the environment, just do (from the project root):

    ```Shell
    sudo env_UID=$UID env_GID=$GID docker-compose up
    ```

Then you will watch the Docker images being built and launched as containers.

### Access to host' devices
If you want to have access to an host device like cameras, just edit the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/robotsthatdream/cafer_docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) [following this guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#devices).

## TODO

- Enable video hardware acceleration on container (by sharing the GPU as a device, as described [HERE](http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/Hardware%20Acceleration)).
